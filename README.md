# Open Source APM Landscape
Model for the open-source application performance management (APM) landscape presented on the [OpenAPM](https://openapm.io/landscape) website.
The landscape illustrates the possibilities of combining different open-source tools to build tailored APM solutions.

## Build
Building means combining all model files into one JSON file. The easiest way to do this is to execute the following command:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run-script build
```
The output file will be written to `build/model.json`.
